# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 Challange

## Overview of the analysis

The objective of this analysis is to visually show the weekly fare for PyBer ride sharing services based on each City type from January 01, 2019, to April 28, 2019. The initial request had included the date of April 29, 2019; But since April 29 is a Monday, data from that date was remove for the graphics in order to graph only complete weeks, preserving the value of the graph.


## Results

As shown in the line graph below, the total fare for urban cities are by far much higher than for suburban and rural cities. The line graph also shows that rural cities fare per week have been relatively flat, which suggests there has been little growth in fare collected weekly in this type of cities. The fares by week for urban and suburban cities show that the fare by week have increase from January to the end of April.

## Summary

Although the data from January to April is a very small time frame to infer larger trends in the fare per week, the might my start to show that rural cities have little room for growth in the fares by week, beside to have about a third less fares per week than urban cities and about have less that suburban cities. In the contrary we are seeing growth in the fare by weeks in urban and suburban cities, this combined with the higher fare per week could represent on opportunity to PyBer to focus more strategies in these type of cities to accelerate revenue growth.
